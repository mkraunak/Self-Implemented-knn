# Self-Implemented-knn

Goal is to the orientation (rotation) of the image using self implemented KNN without any library

Data:
A dataset of images from the Flickr photo sharing website where each image is converted to 8 x 8 x 3 (the third dimension is because color images are stored as three separate planes â€“ red, green, and blue) = 192 vector i.e. one image per row


kNN - 71.262
